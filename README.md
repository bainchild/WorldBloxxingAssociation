World Bloxxing Association
---
Repository that stores 3 projects relating to (what started as) bloxxing_match:
  - [bloxxing_match](/bloxxing_match/): Roblox API replacement through DNS.
  - [bloxxing_referee](/bloxxing_referee/): Cluster management for RCCService & similar.
  - [bloxxing_franchise](/bloxxing_franchise/): Grid management for referee.

Eventually, there will be a 4th project that will replace RCCService,  
but that would be a huge project and take like 2 years of constant effort,  
not counting the extra time it'd take to learn network reverse engineering,  
so not anytime soon.
